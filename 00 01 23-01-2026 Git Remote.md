## 📘 Assignment: Create a Remote GitHub Repository & Push Code

### 🎯 Objective

Learn how to clone a remote GitHub repository, update code locally, and push changes back to the remote repository.

---

## 📝 Assignment Steps

### 1️⃣ Clone the Remote Repository

Clone the existing GitHub repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/atulkamble/myrepo.git
```

Move into the repository directory:

```bash
cd myrepo
```

---

### 2️⃣ Pull Latest Changes (Best Practice)

Before making any changes, sync your local repo with the remote:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

---

### 3️⃣ Modify / Update Code Locally

* Open the project in your editor
* Make required changes (add/edit files, update code, etc.)
* Save all changes

---

### 4️⃣ Stage the Changes

Add all modified files to the staging area:

```bash
git add .
```

---

### 5️⃣ Commit the Changes

Commit your changes with a meaningful message:

```bash
git commit -m "Updated code"
```

---

### 6️⃣ Push Changes to Remote Repository

Push the committed code to the `main` branch on GitHub:

```bash
git push origin main
```

---

## ✅ Expected Outcome

* Code successfully pushed to GitHub
* Changes visible in the remote repository
* No pending local changes (`git status` should be clean)

---

## 📌 Notes for Students

* Always run `git pull` before starting work
* Use clear and meaningful commit messages
* Resolve conflicts if prompted during pull or push
